# Hackathons

Welcome to the Hackathons repository. This repository contains Jupyter notebooks and datasets from various hackathons participated in, including those from platforms like Machinehack, Kaggle, DataHack, and Hackerearth.

## Overview

The goal of this repository is to showcase the work done in various hackathons, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and predictions. The models built range from regression models to complex machine learning models, depending on the problem statement of the hackathon.

## Key Components

- **Jupyter Notebooks**: Each Jupyter notebook corresponds to a hackathon and contains the complete workflow from data loading, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, model building, and making predictions.

- **Datasets**: The datasets are provided in CSV format and are used for building and validating the models. Each dataset corresponds to a specific hackathon.

## Getting Started

To get started with this repository, clone the repository and install the required Python packages. You can then run the Jupyter notebooks to understand the workflow and the methodologies used.

Please note that this repository is a collection of different hackathons, and each hackathon might require a different set of Python packages.
